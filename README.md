# Multisensor Approaches for Outdoor Person Detection

The problem of person detection has been investigated in many domains using various sensors such as cameras and lidars. In robotic applications, for safe navigation and interaction, it is important to have a robust person detector. The outdoor environments imposes challenges for accurate person detection. Fusing modalities from different sensors is a common way to obtain higher accuracy. 

This repository provides several open-source approaches for person detection in outdoor environments. We analyze the performance of methods that fuse RGB and Lidar data. Experiments are conducted on KITTI dataset.
